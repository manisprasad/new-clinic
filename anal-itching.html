            <p>The anus is the opening at the lower end of the gastrointestinal tract through which feces get eliminated
                from the body. Anal itching refers to the itching of the skin surrounding the anus. Anal itching is
                medically called Pruritus Ani and is a highly common condition. Usually, anal itching gets worse at
                night and after the passing of stool. In some cases, there may also be burning and redness around the
                anal area. Scratching of the anal area may lead to cracks and raise the chances of local infection. Anal
                itching can be treated successfully with homeopathic medicines. Homeopathic treatment for anal itching
                helps cure anal itching using medicines that are prepared from naturally occurring substances. Hence,
                these medicines are safe to use for people of all ages.</p>
            <h2>Causes for Anal Itching</h2>
            <p>Anal itching is a symptom not a disease, and can arise due to various reasons. Common causes of anal
                itching include pinworms, piles, anal fissures, anal fistula, and genital warts. Yeast infection is
                another reason for anal itching. Diabetes mellitus and HIV predispose a person to yeast infection.
                Continuous moisture around the anus from sweat or loose stool is another reason for anal itching. Other
                causes of anal itching include eating very spicy food, peppers, caffeine and chocolates; skin tags;
                taking strong antibiotics; skin problems like eczema and psoriasis; and improper hygiene of the anal
                area. In some cases, there is no particular cause for anal itching. This condition is called Idiopathic
                Pruritus Ani.</p>
            <h2>Homeopathic Treatment for Anal Itching</h2>
            <p>There is a long list of medicines in the homeopathic treatment for anal itching. Some of the most

                Peruviana, Sulphur, and Silicea. The reasons behind anal itching as well as the associated symptoms like

                patient feels the need to pass stool very frequently and ends up passing a small quantity of stool at a
                time. In addition to frequent stool, there is a burning sensation in the anus. Nux Vomica is also
                helpful in cases where the intake of coffee or highly spicy food worsens anal itching.</p>

                sensation in the anal area. The burning gets better after washing with cold water. In addition to this,
                sharp splinter like pains in the anus may be present.</p>
            <h3><strong>4. Sulphur – Homeopathic Medicine for Anal Itching Accompanied by a Red and Sore Anus</strong>

                another indication for using Sulphur. An itchy anus, because of skin complaints like eczema and
                psoriasis, is another symptom that requires the use of Sulphur.</p>

                in the rectum after partial expulsion. Silicea is also an effective medicine when anal itching arises in
                cases of anal fistula.</p>
