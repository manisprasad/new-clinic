            </div>
            <p>If your child constantly&nbsp;has a <strong>blocked nose, breathes from the mouth or snores</strong>,
                chances are there that he/ she might have enlarged adenoids. Adenoid enlargement is a problem affecting
                children, those in the 3-10 years age group are the most vulnerable. But what does enlarged adenoids
                mean? It refers to the <strong>enlargement of adenoids i.e. the lymphoid tissue located at the junction
                    of the back of the nose and throat</strong>. Like tonsils, they are a part of the body’s immune
                system and play a major role in fighting infections in children. Adenoids help&nbsp;<strong>fight the
                    bacteria and virus entering the body via the nose</strong>. They normally grow up till &nbsp;5-7
                years of age and thereafter, they start shrinking and finally disappear around teenage. This is the
                physiological growth and regression pattern of adenoids, which are needed only until the child becomes a
                teenager. By that time, the other immune systems get mature enough to fight infections and disease. The
                adenoids, which are no longer needed, regress and disappear.</p>
            <h3><strong>Homeopathic Treatment Of Enlarged Adenoids</strong></h3>
            <p>Homeopathic medicines are a natural and safe alternative to surgery in children with enlarged adenoids.
                Adenoids, when surgically removed, have the tendency to regrow, it has been noted. Homeopathic
                medicines, on the other hand, focus on&nbsp;<strong>strengthening the child’s immune
                    system</strong>.&nbsp;Once the immunity is strong, the child becomes less susceptible to recurrent
                respiratory infections. Once this&nbsp;key factor leading to enlarged adenoids is&nbsp;treated, the
                adenoids get the time to shrink and go back to their normal size.</p>
            <p>Homeopathy treats adenoids in&nbsp;<strong>two phases</strong>. In the first phase, homeopathic
                medicines&nbsp;<strong>treat the ongoing infection</strong>, which is recurrent and generally acute and
                has caused the condition in the present moment. In the second phase, these medicines&nbsp;<strong>build
                    immunity</strong>&nbsp;to prevent chronic respiratory infections. Homeopathic medicines are safe and
                do not have any adverse side effects. They treat the condition of enlarged adenoids in a very gentle and
                natural way.</p>
            <h2><strong>Homeopathic Medicines To Treat Enlarged Adenoids</strong></h2>
            <p>Homeopathic medicines that work wonders in treating enlarged adenoids include&nbsp;<strong>Agraphis
                    Nutans, Baryta Carb, Calcarea Carb, Sambucus, Ammonium Carb, Kali Sulphuricum, Nux Vomica and
                    Tuberculinum</strong></p>

                </strong>is also very effective when enlargement of adenoids and tonsils is present together at the same
                time.</p>

                tonsils may have enlarged together simultaneously. In acute phase of URTI (upper respiratory tract
                infection), pain in the throat on swallowing, sneezing and thick yellow nasal discharge may also be
                seen. The mouth gives off an offensive odour. The child may be physically inactive and sluggish.</p>

                very prominent which is the most troublesome at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chronic tendency to infections
                results in enlarged adenoids or tonsils. Such children also tend to perspire excessively on the scalp.
            </p>
            <p><strong>When and How to use Calcarea Carb?</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>8. Tuberculinum – Homeopathic Medicines To Treat Recurrent Infections Causing Enlarged
                    Adenoids</strong></h3>
            <p>Tuberculinum is a very effective homeopathic medicine to help build a child’s immunity so that he does
                not catch infections repeatedly. Children needing it are very sensitive to weather changes and highly
                susceptible to infections. They frequently suffer from sore throat, colds and upper respiratory tract
                infections. These medicines are given in chronic cases and when no active infection is present. They
                strengthen the body’s immune system.</p>
            <p><strong>When and How to use Tuberculinum?</strong></p>
            <p>Tuberculinum is mainly used as a medicine to boost a child’s immunity that will make a child less
                susceptible to catch frequent infections. It is mainly used in 200C or higher potencies. The dose varies
                from just one dose in 15 days or in a month depending on the age of the child and severity of problem.
                It is advised not to self-medicate with this medicine as it is a strong remedy. Always use this medicine
                only after consulting a homeopathic physician.</p>
            <p><u>Note </u>Use of these medicines is recommended only in mild to moderate cases. They can be used for
                about a month or two in recommended potency and dose. For further continuation of these medicines or for
                increasing dose or potency, kindly consult a homeopathic physician. In severe cases (for example, sleep
                apnea, mouth breathing even during daytime, recurrent ear infections or retarded overall growth of
                child), kindly take help from conventional mode of treatment as homeopathy has its limitations in
                treating severe cases of enlarged adenoids.</p>
            <h2><strong>Cause Behind Adenoids Enlargement</strong></h2>
            <p>Adenoids are present in every child that act as the first line of defense in the body along with tonsils.
                However, this does not mean that adenoids will get enlarged in every child.&nbsp;<strong>Recurrent upper
                    respiratory tract infections (URTI) and nasal allergies</strong>&nbsp;put a child at risk and cause
                adenoids to enlarge. As soon as the germs enter via the nose, adenoids trap them and fight them. In this
                process, the adenoids get temporarily swollen. With time, this swelling reduces and they come back to
                their original size. However, if the infections are recurrent, the adenoids, due to constant swelling,
                are unable to return to normal size and get permanently enlarged even in the absence of any acute URTI.
            </p>
            <h2><strong>Signs And Symptoms Of Enlarged Adenoids</strong></h2>
            <p>1<strong>. Nasal blockage </strong>causing&nbsp;<strong>mouth breathing, </strong>noisy breathing
                and&nbsp;<strong>snoring</strong></p>
            <p>2. Dry mouth, dry cracked lips, offensive breath due to breathing from mouth</p>
            <p>3. Disturbed, restless sleep; drowsiness and sleepiness during the day; difficulty in concentration</p>
            <p>4. Nasal voice, enlarged glands in the neck, frequent colds, sore throat and difficult swallowing.
                Appetite may also be poor. A child having enlarged adenoids has a blocked nose and breathes through the
                mouth. Chewing and breathing at the same time are difficult, therefore these children avoid eating at
                all.</p>
            <p>5. Adenoid facies: The term facies refers to a set of specific facial features in a person suffering from
                a particular disease. The typical set of facial features noted in a child having enlarged adenoids is
                known as adenoid facies. The features of adenoid facies include a long face, open mouth, high arched
                palate, prominent incisors, short upper lip and a pinched nose.</p>
            <h3><strong>Complications Of Enlarged Adenoids</strong></h3>
            <p>1. <strong>Sleep apnea </strong>(momentary pauses in breathing arise during sleep) in severe cases. Sleep
                apnea leads to poor sleep, fatigue and difficulty concentrating in studies at school.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Ear-related complaints </strong>such as difficulty in hearing, deafness and ear infections.
                The eustachian tube connects the throat to the middle ear. When the adenoids get enormously enlarged,
                they may block these eustachian tubes, leading to deafness or middle ear infection.</p>
            <p>3. In fact, persistently enlarged adenoids <strong>retard the overall development of</strong>&nbsp;the
                child. The retarded growth in such cases is attributed to two main factors – poor appetite leading to
                nutritional deficiencies, and improper sleep. The growth hormone required in children is primarily
                secreted during sleep. A child who lacks sound sleep will have lower levels of this growth hormone and
                hence, suffer poor growth and development.</p>
            <h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>My child has a persistently blocked nose, are&nbsp;enlarged adenoids to blame?</strong></p>
            <p>Blocked nose is a key feature of enlarged adenoids and is attended with symptoms like mouth breathing and
                snoring. However, nasal allergies and nasal polyps may also cause a blocked nose. So a diagnosis and
                X-ray of soft tissue of the neck are needed before enlarged adenoids can be established as the cause.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Can enlarged adenoids and enlarged tonsils appear at the same time?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes. Tonsils are located in the back of the throat, one on either side, and are a part of the child’s
                defense mechanism along with adenoids. Both adenoids and tonsils are masses of lymphoid tissue. There
                are high chances for both adenoids and tonsils to get enlarged at the same time.</p>
            <p><strong>Our ENT specialist has advised adenoid surgery for my son. Is it wise to try homeopathic
                    medicines at this stage?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, it is. Why put the child through the trauma of surgery? Even though conventional medicine treats
                enlarged adenoids as a case for surgical intervention, proper homeopathic medicines can treat the
                condition in a safe and natural way. Homeopathic medicines do not take very long to show positive
                results in some measure. How much they can help and for how long they need to be taken depends on the
                severity of the condition.</p>
            <p><strong>Can adenoids grow back after surgery?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, there is a fair chance they will. This is because even though the adenoids have been incised, the
                root cause behind their enlargement remains. Homeopathy first attacks and fixes the root cause, for
                example recurrent respiratory infections, and then helps the adenoids shrink back to normal size.</p>
