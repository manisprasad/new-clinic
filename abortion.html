    <h1>Best Homeopathic Medicines for Recurrent/Habitual Abortion, Threatened Abortion</h1>


    <h2>What is abortion? </h2>
    Abortion refers to expulsion of the fetus from uterus before the 20th week of gestation. When abortion occurs
    spontaneously, it is referred to as spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. Vaginal bleeding occurring during the first
    20 weeks of pregnancy is referred to as threatened abortion. Bleeding varies from light spotting to heavy bleeding.
    This may or may not be attended with abdominal pain. Recurrent or habitual abortion refers to three or more
    spontaneous abortions occurring one after the other without any intervening pregnancy.

    <h3>Risk factors for recurrent/habitual abortion, threatened abortion</h3>
        The risk factors that predispose a woman to threatened abortion are age above 35 years, abdominal trauma,
        bacterial/viral infection during pregnancy, chromosomal abnormalities, multiple pregnancy (pregnancy with more
        than one fetus), growths in uterus like fibroids, problems with placenta, smoking. The various factors that
        predispose one to repeated abortion are malformation of uterus, cervical incompetence, hormone disorders
        including hypothyroidism, PCOS, diabetes mellitus, chromosomal disorders, endometritis, infections such as
        toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, coxsackie virus and measles. In addition, lifestyle
        factors such as smoking, alcohol and drugs intake also put women at a high risk of repeated abortion.
