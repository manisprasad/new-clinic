            </div>
            <p>Milk allergy is a common food allergy among children. It results from an over-reaction of the immune
                system towards the protein in the milk or milk products. In children who are allergic to milk, the
                immune system recognizes the protein in the milk as a harmful foreign substance and starts an immune
                reaction to fight against it. This symptoms related to this immune reaction varies from person to
                person. Homeopathic medicines treat milk allergy by optimizing the immune system. Once the immune system
                is moderated, the intensity and severity of the symptoms get reduced.</p>

                goat milk. The immune response is primarily generated against the protein alpha S1-casein present in the
                cow’s milk. A person having atopic dermatitis, any other allergies or a family history of allergies is
                at risk to suffer from a milk allergy.</p>
